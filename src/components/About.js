        <p>
          I am a writer of essays and short stories. I earned a
          B.S. in Television and Film Production from Syracuse University and 
          worked as a Field Producer in Public Television in Boston and San
          Francisco. I was also an IACUC board member at Takeda
          Pharmaceuticals, and a substitute elementary school teacher. I
          no longer shoplift but instead sculpt the human figure, work on
          being a better environmentalist, lift weights and edit my kidsâ€™
          essays when they allow it.
