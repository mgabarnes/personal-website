        <p>
          I am a writer of essays and short stories. I earned a B.S. in
          Television and Film Production from Syracuse University and worked as
          a Field Producer in Public Television in Boston and San Francisco. I
          was also an IACUC board member at Takeda Pharmaceuticals, and a
          substitute elementary school teacher. I love to photograph what moves
          me, sculpt the human figure, and find adventure.
