        <p>
          As an electrical and computer engineering masters student at
          Northeastern University, I am passionate about harnessing technology
          to improve people's lives. With internships at companies known for
          their innovative approaches to engineering, Tesla and Fresenius
          Medical Care, I have acquired valuable hands-on experience and
          developed a strong foundation in various aspects of electrical
          engineering, including embedded systems, firmware design, PCB design,
          and project ownership.
        </p>
        <p>
          Through these internships and my academic coursework, I have honed my
          skills in critical thinking, problem-solving, and effective
          communication. I have also had the opportunity to collaborate with
          cross-functional teams, learning the importance of teamwork and
          adaptability in fast-paced environments.
        </p>
        <p>
          As I continue my journey in the field of electrical engineering, I
          eagerly look forward to expanding my knowledge, embracing new
          challenges, and contributing to the advancement of technology.
