      <ul>
        <li>
          During my tenure as an Altium Designer Consultant at Liberty Defense,
          I specialized in creating and managing PCB components. My work
          resulted in a well-organized library management system, significantly
          streamlining the design process across diverse teams and projects.

          A key accomplishment was my contribution to the HEXWAVE System, a
          next-gen body scanner. My Altium components underpin this system,
          which uses AI and 3D imaging to swiftly and accurately detect
          concealed items. This high-throughput portal epitomizes my
          professional expertise and commitment to innovative solutions.
