      <ul>
        <li>
          Directed the electrical and mechanical development of the electric
          vehicle's charging system for the Formula Hybrid SAE competition, from
          the idea phase through manufacturing.
        </li>
        <li>
          Created and integrated the charger's schematic into the master
          schematic of the formula-style electric vehicle.
        </li>
        <li>
          Integrated the TSM 2500 CAN-enabled charger into the design, ensuring
          proper communication with the onboard Battery Management System (BMS).
        </li>
      </ul>
