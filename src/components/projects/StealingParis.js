        In 1982, I stole some beautiful things in Paris. Looking back, I
        realized I learned how to maintain my composure after earlier failed
        attempts at thieving. In 1967, I was five when I was lined up with my
        five older siblings and accused of throwing a half-opened can of Spam
        behind a box of gift-wrapping paper in the basement. I’d twisted the
        aluminum key off its track and tried to throw away the evidence. My
        mother found it months later. By 1980, I wasn’t much better and got
        caught red-faced and red-handed at an all-girls camp on Lake Sebago. I
        was a counselor and the last to leave at the end of the summer. When my
        father came to pick me up, the extra tall, lean, and refined director
        told my less tall, lean, and refined dad that I’d taken a camper’s
        riding boots. I’d ridden a horse once, but I thought the boots looked
        hot on me.
        <li />

          “Don’t worry about it,” my father said, his gruff Italian accent
          comforting me, as it often had, on the long ride home. He knew the
          previous years had been tough with the divorce, the moves, my mother’s
          addictions and affairs, and his limited appearances. He also knew he
          wasn’t one to preach. At eleven, I was a de facto accomplice in a
          heist he’d arranged with my mother. One day when my sister was working
          as a cashier at a local drugstore, he made her look the other way as
          we left with carts of milk, bread, maxi pads, toilet paper, and
          anything else we could stuff in them. That was the early seventies
          when inflation and unemployment were the highest since the Great
          Depression. My father had lost his job as a mechanical engineer. He
          found what work he could, driving chickens to markets and pumping gas.
          But it wasn’t enough to pay the mortgage and groceries for a family of
          nine. Lore had it he was groomed at the same age he christened me when
          his immigrant Italian father resurfaced and bribed him to transport
          bags of cash on trains out of Providence.
        </li>
        <li>
          In my junior year of college, my mussy, brown-haired boyfriend asked
          me to go to France on a study abroad program. “Apply for a grant,” he
          told me, his plump lips framing his straight white teeth.
        </li>
        <li>
          I pleaded with the director of the program. “I’ve always wanted to
          study in France. I’ll work harder than anyone.” The suited, young,
          white man studied me. “I can’t go if I don’t receive the grant,” I
          said, between bits of saltwater falling from my cheeks. The truth was
          I hadn’t ever imagined studying in France until then. The opportunity
          had given me hope: a zipline to freedom, in an adventurous place where
          my family could not reach me. Within weeks, I received the award and
          more loans than I could afford and, with my Burger King wages, I
          bought a one-way ticket to France.
        </li>

          “You Americans,” my host brother Jacques said, smiling at me after I
          arrived in Strasbourg. His dark almond-shaped eyes and symmetrical
          features drew me to him, and his French accent and English fluency
          captivated me. “You have too much weight.” His coarse mustache and
          silky black hair glistened against his olive skin. I smiled, unsure of
          how to respond and already believing he knew more about Americans than
          me.
        </li>
        <li>
          Each day on my way to Syracuse University’s Strasbourg branch, I
          passed Gothic cathedrals and self-assured Parisians dressed in flared
          wool coats, snug pants, and tapered dresses, fashion I believed they
          had chosen to accentuate already slender figures. “Elle a les grands
          pieds,” a shoe clerk said, smirking at his coworker. My size nine feet
          were just another American anomaly, another of my body’s oddities. I
          wanted to fit in and avoid being pitied in my khakis, docksiders, and
          large sweaters meant to hide my extra American weight. Mostly, I
          wanted to conceal my history to evade judgment. I wanted to be cloaked
          in a bit of mystery, so I’d have a better chance of succeeding rather
          than being pegged as that poor young woman with a glossy-eyed mother
          who smelled of vodka and forest skunk in the doghouse near the tracks.
        </li>
        <li>
          “Did you stop at the patisserie?” My robed host mother asked every
          afternoon, greeting me at the door of her dimly lit apartment. One of
          her hands always rested on a protruding belly, her head and forefinger
          twitching left to right. “Eh?” She waited for my answer, chewing some
          ephemeral thing. The shaming felt familiar. Some days I told her the
          truth, but most, I would just say, “No.” I wanted to stop hunting down
          mille-feuilles and chocolate croissants, but the gooey, sweet euphoria
          simultaneously beckoned and distracted me. The doughy layers and
          oozing fillings triggered memories of walks with my mother to our
          neighborhood patisserie, where she practiced her French buying crusty
          baguettes and pastel-frosted petit fours. The oven scents enveloped me
          like a soothing soak in the tub. That was when I climbed trees, played
          street hockey, and picked raspberries from our gardens, my mom always
          drowning the fruit in cream and sugar. When she smelled of soap and
          roses and sang, playing the piano so loudly the neighbors could hear
          her. When we laughed, the bellyaching, choking-on-saliva bouts of
          laughter. When rainy days were treasured with sweet tea and cookies,
          and summers were spent at the beach or on road trips studying maps and
          visiting relatives on the northeastern coast.
        </li>
        <li>
          At eleven, the piano along with most of our furniture disappeared when
          my parents divorced. “I can’t take anything that reminds me of that
          house,” my mother told my younger brother and me. “Or your father.” I
          wondered what horrific things he had done for her to cut this final
          cord. I’d heard their arguments. She was known for oversharing. I
          heard he had followed her and listened to her conversations with a man
          she had met at a local college where she was taking classes. Years
          earlier, when I was just six, I’d heard her on a call with my father’s
          colleague. “He cashed out all our savings. Even the kid’s accounts,
          and plans on leaving with a woman from work!” She raged and called
          anyone who would listen, pacing the house for what seemed like days.
          That was at the end of the most glorious summer we had ever had, after
          my mother had spent most of her father’s inheritance renting a beach
          house on a cliff overlooking a grand expanse of the ocean in
          Middletown, RI. Some weekends, my father made the trip from Providence
          to Middletown. But our family priest spent more time with us that
          summer than he did, holding church services on our rolling lawn and
          meeting us at the beach.
        </li>
        <li>
          After the divorce, we took our beds, bureaus, and a bookcase filled
          with my mother’s journals, family photo albums, and a few books from
          our colonial near Brown, with its barn-like garage and stained-glass
          windows, to a rental on a former junkyard, a block from commercial
          railroad tracks. Remnants of tires, metal pipes, and grocery carts
          poked up from patches of grass surrounding the home, whispers of
          trauma that had begun to emerge.
        </li>
        <li>
          By high school, my mother stashed vodka in her bag, bookshelves, and
          car. When she wasn’t working or sleeping with sedatives and men she
          met in jazz clubs by the Seekonk River, she shared her pot with me.
          She thought that sharing the pot would help calm our anxieties.
          Instead, charading as a bonding moment, it temporarily anesthetized
          us, assuaged her guilt, and planted the seeds of my addiction. “My
          father made these when I had a cold,” she told me and handed me a hot
          toddy when I was sick one day. I’m not sure why she thought that would
          be a comforting thought since she had also told me how he had been an
          abusive alcoholic. But like my relationship with her, her relationship
          with her father, a failed newspaperman, had been conflicted, layered
          with love and disgust.
        </li>
        <li>
          After moving into the rental, my younger brother and I were often left
          alone. Our bodies slowly began to swell from the pasta, potatoes, and
          PB & J’s we largely ate that never seemed to fill us. So I stole tea
          and crackers from Sister Mary’s library office where I worked in
          exchange for tuition after school. I wanted my siblings to come back
          around our top-heavy Lazy Susan steadying glasses of milk and plates
          of hamburger helper from the minor quakes set off by the jockeying of
          arms and legs around the table. Inevitably, the two-toned, brown
          ceramic pitcher of equal parts powdered and bottled milk would spill,
          sending the back of my father’s hand careening against the shoulder of
          the offender. “What’s the mattah with you?” he’d ask, never wanting an
          answer. I missed how my mother had begun experimenting with food
          before our family split up. Instead of one-pot meals, she made
          ambrosia, baked Alaska, and vichyssoise after befriending her French
          professor. Just the thought of ice cream baked in a cake covered with
          sugary singed egg whites made my mouth water.
        </li>
        <li>
          In France, the fat shaming from my host family coincided with my
          growing infatuation with Jacques. I began to eat less. At night, we
          lay on his wiry twin bed, tucked against pale walls bathed in yellow
          light listening to older American pop bands like the Alan Parsons
          Project and Rupert Holmes. “If you like Pina Coladas…,” pressing play
          and then rewind over and over on his cassette player. He was gentle,
          and the first person I’d been with who rarely drank and didn’t smoke.
          I wanted his self-assurance. Most nights, I never left his bed. By
          then, I had severed my relationship with my American boyfriend, whose
          primary focus had become Alsatian beer. “I’ll never marry you,”
          Jacques told me one night. “You aren’t Jewish.” Just then, his mother
          poked her head in the doorway of his room, shaking her head and
          forefinger from left to right.
        </li>
        <li>
          “No,” she said. “Never.” They were a family of conservative Jews from
          Morocco who had traveled north after WWII. At the time, I didn’t
          understand the extent of his family’s torment. I knew they had
          experienced prejudice and pain. I had seen disdainful glances tossed
          their way and the armed guards at local temples. And because of that,
          I believed he would understand my sorrow. I knew our pain was not the
          same. But if he understood how to persevere in the face of trauma, I
          thought I could learn from him and possibly do the same. At twenty
          years old and having known Jacques for just a few months, the idea of
          marriage was absurd. But I wanted his empathy and his love. So I
          focused on eating less.
        </li>
        <li>
          When my jeans began to hang loosely from me, I tailored them to fit so
          tightly that I rivaled the French women I had envied. “Eat something,”
          Jacques said, offering me a piece of bread one morning. “You’re not
          eating anything.” It was the confirmation I needed as I began my
          transformation. The change had triggered a power shift, and a certain
          exhilaration set in.
        </li>
        <li>
          Before Christmas, our class took a field trip to Paris. Strasbourg is
          an Alsatian city best known for its German influence, sparkling wine,
          and the Petite France District, where ancient timbered houses line
          canals connected by cobblestone bridges. It was quaint but I wanted to
          visit flagship department stores and museums of famous French
          sculptors in the City of Love. I wanted to see the latest in fashion
          draped on slinky Parisian models like those in Vogue and Elle
          magazines. If I could begin to look like them, I wondered what other
          possibilities existed for me. “Go to school and travel the world,” my
          mother had always told me. “Before you settle down.” I wanted to see
          the cake-like tiers and spires trimmed in gold of the Paris Printemps.
          So, when I finally arrived to see the grande dame of department
          stores, my head tilted back and my lips turned up at the spectacle.
        </li>
        <li>
          Inside, beyond racks of taffeta dresses and weighty-shouldered suits,
          were rows of kitten-soft pink and blue cashmere sweaters. My only
          experience with something so silken was when I’d worn my grandmother’s
          chocolate-peppered fur coat in high school. Or rather, it wore me. She
          moved from Nova Scotia to New York 1919 after being offered a spot at
          a nursing school to help fight the flu pandemic. She wore those
          achievements with such pride and sternness people paid attention to
          her. That’s how I felt when I wore the fur coat, even if its satin
          lining was torn and hung askew from my shoulders down to my uniform
          navy knee socks.
        </li>
        <li>
          In Printemps, I took a fluffy pink pullover off the rack and found an
          empty suite of dressing rooms. I removed my gray rayon and cotton
          turtleneck and slipped the cashmere sweater on. Its feather-like
          fibers brushed my exposed flesh. The V-neck framed my small breasts
          perfectly, and the gently cinched waist minimized the soft round of my
          stomach. My abdominal muscles clenched as I removed the sweater and
          put my shirt back on. With one finger between two of my house keys, I
          pried the front and back of the security tag apart, detached it from
          the garment, and pushed the broken pieces under the bench with my big
          American foot. Then I rolled up the buttery knit, pushed it into the
          bottom of my backpack, and left.
        </li>
        <li>
          Outside, a warm chill rose in me despite the December temperatures. It
          lingered into the metro and along the rocking and rolling of the train
          ride to the Rodin Museum. I knew my offense would never affect the
          owners of such a palatial company. Instead, I thought about the
          perfect anatomies I’d seen of European sculptures in art and
          textbooks, and about how my new sweater would complement my figure and
          might distract from my lack of fluency and sophistication. At the
          Rodin Museum, a maze of dormant rose bushes and boxy evergreens
          greeted guests. The formidable mansion had housed dukes and duchesses.
          At one time, it was also a brothel, then a convent, and an apartment
          building before finally being transformed into a museum after the
          artist’s death in 1917. As I walked through its gates, I remembered
          roaming Swan Point Cemetery with my mother in Providence, past
          headstones and ponds spotted with lily pads and reflections, and
          through thick green gardens dotted with figures of those buried there.
          The Thinker, in its heroic size and stature, sat opposite the entrance
          to the Rodin Museum. His head rested in his hand. I wanted to be bold
          and thoughtful, to know that I was brilliant like Rodin had. Inside
          the 18th-century building, the head of a female bust tilted up as if
          The Scream was rising from the dead and mouthing silent cries.The
          desperation felt familiar. Then I saw flashes of shouting, slapping,
          and falling.
        </li>
        <li>
          I wound my way through the museum towards The Kiss, with its two nudes
          wrapped in each other’s arms. My eyes traced the light along the
          chiseled tissue and bone of the slippery white marble, while my
          fingers snuck touches. I wondered if I could create that type of love
          in my life if I memorized the shape of the figures.
        </li>
        <li>
          In the gift shop, the buzz of receipt printers and benign
          conversations replaced the echoes of shoes striking marble. Carousels
          filled with glossy postcards tilted and swayed. One by one, I removed
          pictures of The Scream, The Thinker, and The Kiss from their metal
          slots. I walked towards a rack of scarves and feigned interest in two
          of them. When the cashier’s attention turned elsewhere, I slipped the
          cards into my bag and left the shop, too elated to feel anything else.
